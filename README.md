## Avail Nexus Integration

### What is Avail Nexus?
Avail Nexus is a cutting-edge cross-chain infrastructure that enables seamless interoperability between different blockchains. TradeVerse leverages the Avail Nexus SDK to provide users with a unified experience across multiple chains without the complexity of manual bridging.

### How TradeVerse Uses Avail Nexus

#### **Unified Token Management**
- **Single Interface**: Users can view all their token balances across Ethereum, Base, Polygon, and other supported chains in one dashboard
- **Real-time Sync**: Balances are automatically synchronized and updated across all chains
- **Cross-chain Visibility**: No need to switch between different chain interfaces

#### **One-Click Cross-Chain Operations**
- **Bridge & Execute**: Users can bridge tokens from one chain and immediately create trading orders on another chain in a single transaction
- **Automatic Approvals**: Token approvals are handled automatically during cross-chain operations
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient routing reduces gas costs and transaction complexity

#### **Enhanced Security**
- **Secure Bridging**: All cross-chain operations are secured through Avail's proven infrastructure
- **Transaction Verification**: Cross-chain transactions are verified and validated before execution
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduced risk of failed transactions or lost funds during cross-chain operations

#### **Developer Benefits**
- **Simple Integration**: Easy-to-use SDK with comprehensive TypeScript support
- **Type Safety**: Full type safety for all cross-chain operations
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user feedback for failed operations
- **Simulation Support**: Test cross-chain operations before execution

### Key Avail Nexus Features in TradeVerse

```typescript
// Unified balance fetching across all chains
const balances = await getUnifiedBalances();
// Returns: [{ symbol: 'ETH', balance: '1.5', chainId: 1 }, ...]

// One-click bridge and create order
const result = await bridgeAndCreateOrder({
  token: 'ETH',
  amount: '1.0',
  toChainId: 8453, // Base
  tokenAddress: '0x...',
  price: '2000',
  expirationHours: 24
});

// Simulate operations before execution
const simulation = await simulateBridgeAndCreateOrder(params);
```
