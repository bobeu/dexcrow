## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the agent directory with the following variables:

```env
# ASI1 API Key for supercar knowledge and responses
ASI_ONE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

# Agentverse URL (default for hosted agents)
AGENTVERSE_URL=https://agentverse.ai
```

## Installation & Setup

1. **Get ASI1 API Key**: Obtain your API key from [ASI1](https://asi1.ai)
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Update the `.env` file with your actual API key
3. **Deploy to Agentverse**: The agent is ready for deployment to Agentverse

## Usage

### Starting a Session

When you start a chat session with the agent, it will:
1. Send a welcome message with available capabilities
2. Advertise its supercar expertise
3. Wait for your questions about supercars

### Asking Questions

You can ask about:
- Specific supercar models (e.g., "Tell me about the McLaren P1")
- Performance comparisons (e.g., "How does the LaFerrari compare to the P1?")
- Technical details (e.g., "What's the difference between active and passive aerodynamics?")
- Market information (e.g., "What's the current value of a 1990s McLaren F1?")
- Racing history (e.g., "Which supercars have won Le Mans?")

### Example Interactions

**User**: "What makes the Bugatti Chiron special?"

**Agent**: "The Bugatti Chiron represents the pinnacle of automotive engineering with several groundbreaking features:

**Power & Performance:**
- 8.0L quad-turbocharged W16 engine producing 1,500 HP
- 0-60 mph in 2.4 seconds, top speed of 261 mph (electronically limited)
- 1,180 lb-ft of torque from just 2,000 RPM

**Engineering Excellence:**
- Advanced carbon fiber monocoque construction
- Sophisticated all-wheel-drive system with torque vectoring
- Active aerodynamics with deployable rear wing
- 7-speed dual-clutch transmission with lightning-fast shifts

**Exclusivity & Heritage:**
- Limited to 500 units, each hand-built in Molsheim, France
- Direct successor to the legendary Veyron
- Named after Louis Chiron, Bugatti's most successful racing driver
- Starting price of $2.7 million, with most selling for significantly more

The Chiron isn't just fast‚Äîit's a rolling testament to what's possible when unlimited resources meet uncompromising engineering standards."

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Framework**: uAgents v0.22.9 with uAgents-core v0.3.9
- **Protocol**: Agent Chat Protocol for ASI1 compatibility
- **API Integration**: ASI1 API for enhanced supercar knowledge
- **Deployment**: Agentverse Hosted Agent

### Dependencies

The agent uses only allowlisted libraries for Agentverse Hosted deployment:
- `uagents` - Core agent framework
- `uagents-core` - Core functionality
- `requests` - HTTP client for API calls

### Error Handling

The agent includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing API keys
- Network timeouts
- API rate limits
- Malformed responses
- Connection issues

## Testing

### Local Testing

1. Set up your environment variables
2. Run the agent locally:
   ```bash
   python agent.py
   ```

### Agentverse Testing

1. Deploy the agent to Agentverse
2. Open the Agent Chat interface
3. Start a session with the agent
4. Test various supercar-related queries

### Test Queries

Try these sample questions:
- "Compare the Ferrari SF90 Stradale to the McLaren Artura"
- "What's the most expensive supercar ever sold?"
- "Explain the difference between a supercar and a hypercar"
- "Which supercar has the best power-to-weight ratio?"
- "Tell me about the Pagani Huayra's active aerodynamics"

## Limitations

- Requires valid ASI1 API key for full functionality
- Responses are limited by ASI1 API rate limits
- Knowledge is current as of the ASI1 model training date
- Focuses specifically on supercars and high-performance vehicles

## Support

For issues or questions:
